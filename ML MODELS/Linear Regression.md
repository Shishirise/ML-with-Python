## ðŸ§  What is Linear Regression?

Linear regression is a **supervised learning algorithm** that models the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) using a straight line:

\[
y = mx + b
\]

Where:
- `y` = predicted value  
- `m` = slope (coefficient)  
- `x` = input feature  
- `b` = y-intercept
