# Parameters in Machine Learning

## 🔹 What are Parameters?
In **machine learning (ML)**, **parameters** are the internal variables of a model that are **learned from data during training**.  
They define how the model makes predictions.

---

## 🔑 Key Points
1. **Learned from data** – Parameters are not set manually; they are adjusted by algorithms like gradient descent to minimize error.
2. **Control predictions** – They determine the relationship between input features and output predictions.
3. **Different for each model** – Parameters depend on the type of ML model.

## 📌 Examples of Parameters in ML

### Example 1: Linear Regression
Equation:  
\[ y = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + b \]

- Parameters: **w1, w2, b**
- Learned from data.

👉 Example: Predicting house price  
- \(w_1 = 150\): every extra square foot adds $150  
- \(w_2 = 10,000\): each bedroom adds $10,000  
- \(b = 50,000\): baseline price

---

### Example 2: Logistic Regression
Equation:  
\[ \hat{y} = \sigma(w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + b) \]

- Parameters: **weights and bias**
- Control probability curve.

👉 Example: Spam detection  
- Word "FREE" → weight = +2.5 (spammy)  
- Word "Hello" → weight = -0.5 (normal)

---

### Example 3: Neural Network
For a single layer:  
\[ y = f(Wx + b) \]

- Parameters: **W (weights), b (biases)**
- Deep networks can have **millions/billions of parameters**.

👉 Example: Image recognition — filters learn edges → shapes → objects.

---

### Example 4: Decision Tree
- Parameters: **splits** and **leaf values** chosen during training.

👉 Example: Loan approval tree  
- Split: "Income > $50k?" (decision rule = parameter).

---

### Example 5: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **No parameters learned!**  
- Just stores training data.  
👉 Relies on hyperparameter: *k* (neighbors count).

---

## ⚖️ Parameters vs Hyperparameters
- **Parameters** → learned automatically (weights, biases).  
- **Hyperparameters** → set before training (learning rate, number of layers, max depth).

---

## 🎯 Real-Life Examples

1. **House Price Prediction:**  
   - Parameters = effect of square footage, bedrooms, etc. on price.  

2. **Email Spam Filter:**  
   - Parameters = weights for words (e.g., "FREE" strongly pushes toward spam).  

3. **Face Recognition:**  
   - Parameters = filters for edges, eye distance, patterns.  

4. **Self-driving Car:**  
   - Parameters = weights deciding steering, braking, recognizing signs.

👉 In real life, parameters = the "knobs and dials" models learn to make accurate predictions.

# Parameters in ChatGPT

## ⚙️ What does “ChatGPT has 1 Trillion Parameters” mean?
- ChatGPT is a **neural network** with **weights and biases (parameters)**.  
- These parameters are the **tiny learned values** that guide how it predicts the next word.  

### 🔹 Example Analogy
- Think of parameters as **1 trillion knobs in a giant brain**.  
- Each knob adjusts how strongly one neuron influences another.  
- Together, they encode knowledge of grammar, facts, reasoning, style.

---

## 🔹 Real-Life Comparison
- Small ML model (Linear Regression): a few parameters.  
- Image recognition CNN: millions of parameters.  
- ChatGPT: **hundreds of billions to trillions of parameters**.

✅ More parameters = more knowledge capacity, but also requires **huge compute and memory**.

---

# ✅ Summary
- **Parameters = learned model variables (weights, biases).**
- They are different from **hyperparameters**, which we set manually.  
- Real-life examples: predicting house prices, detecting spam, face recognition, self-driving cars.  
- ChatGPT’s “1 trillion parameters” = 1 trillion learned weights that allow it to generate human-like text.
