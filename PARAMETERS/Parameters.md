# Parameters in Machine Learning

## 🔹 What are Parameters?
In **machine learning (ML)**, **parameters** are the internal variables of a model that are **learned from data during training**.  
They define how the model makes predictions.

---

## 🔑 Key Points
1. **Learned from data** – Parameters are not set manually; they are adjusted by algorithms like gradient descent to minimize error.
2. **Control predictions** – They determine the relationship between input features and output predictions.
3. **Different for each model** – Parameters depend on the type of ML model.

## 📌 Examples of Parameters in ML

### Example 1: Linear Regression
Equation:  
$$y = w_0 + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2$$

- Parameters: **w₀, w₁, w₂**
- Learned from data.

👉 Example: Predicting house price  
- $w_1 = 150$: every extra square foot adds $150  
- $w_2 = 10,000$: each bedroom adds $10,000  
- $w_0 = 50,000$: baseline price (intercept/bias)

---

### Example 2: Logistic Regression
Equation:  
$$\hat{y} = \sigma(w_0 + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2)$$

Where $\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$ is the sigmoid function.

- Parameters: **w₀, w₁, w₂** (weights and bias)
- Control probability curve.

👉 Example: Spam detection  
- Word "FREE" → weight = +2.5 (increases spam probability)  
- Word "Hello" → weight = -0.5 (decreases spam probability)

---

### Example 3: Neural Network
For a single layer:  
$$y = f(Wx + b)$$

Where:
- **W** is the weight matrix (parameters)
- **b** is the bias vector (parameters)
- **f** is the activation function (ReLU, sigmoid, etc.)

Deep networks can have **millions/billions of parameters**.

👉 Example: Image recognition — filters learn edges → shapes → objects.

---

### Example 4: Decision Tree
- Parameters: **split thresholds** and **leaf values** chosen during training.

👉 Example: Loan approval tree  
- Split: "Income > $50k?" (threshold $50k is a learned parameter).
- Leaf values: "Approve" or "Reject" (learned from training data).

---

### Example 5: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **No parameters learned!**  
- Just stores training data (non-parametric method).  
👉 Relies on hyperparameter: *k* (neighbors count).

---

## ⚖️ Parameters vs Hyperparameters
- **Parameters** → learned automatically during training (weights, biases).  
- **Hyperparameters** → set before training starts (learning rate, number of layers, max depth).

---

## 🎯 Real-Life Examples

1. **House Price Prediction:**  
   - Parameters = coefficients showing effect of square footage, bedrooms, etc. on price.  

2. **Email Spam Filter:**  
   - Parameters = weights for words (e.g., "FREE" strongly pushes toward spam classification).  

3. **Face Recognition:**  
   - Parameters = filters for detecting edges, facial features, and patterns.  

4. **Self-driving Car:**  
   - Parameters = weights in neural networks deciding steering angle, braking force, object recognition.

👉 In real life, parameters = the "knobs and dials" that models learn to adjust for making accurate predictions.

# Parameters in ChatGPT

## ⚙️ What does "ChatGPT has 175 Billion+ Parameters" mean?
- ChatGPT is a **neural network** with **weights and biases (parameters)**.  
- These parameters are the **learned values** that guide how it predicts the next word in a sequence.  

### 🔹 Example Analogy
- Think of parameters as **175+ billion knobs in a giant brain**.  
- Each knob adjusts how strongly one piece of information influences another.  
- Together, they encode knowledge of grammar, facts, reasoning, and writing style.

---

## 🔹 Real-Life Comparison
- Small ML model (Linear Regression): 10-1,000 parameters.  
- Image recognition CNN: 1-100 million parameters.  
- ChatGPT: **175+ billion parameters** (GPT-3), newer models even more.

✅ More parameters = more knowledge capacity and better performance, but also requires **massive compute and memory**.

---

# ✅ Summary
- **Parameters = learned model variables (weights, biases, thresholds).**
- They are different from **hyperparameters**, which we set manually before training.  
- Real-life examples: predicting house prices, detecting spam, face recognition, self-driving cars.  
- ChatGPT's "175+ billion parameters" = billions of learned weights that enable human-like text generation and reasoning.
