## Findings and Results

Found 24991 files belonging to 2 classes.
Using 19993 files for training.
Using 4998 files for validation.
TensorFlow found 24,991 images split into 2 classes (cats and dogs).

80% (19,993 images) are used for training.
20% (4,998 images) are used for validation.
Corrupt JPEG Data Warnings

Corrupt JPEG data: ### extraneous bytes before marker 0xd9
Warning: unknown JFIF revision number 0.00
These are non-critical warnings.
They just mean some images have extra or unusual bytes but are still readable thanks to ImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES = True.
No need to worry â€” your training continues normally.

# Training Progress

# Epoch 1/3
Training started and progressed over 625 steps (batches).
Initial accuracy: ~52% (model is just beginning to learn)
Final accuracy for Epoch 1: 0.5859
Loss: 0.6877
Validation Accuracy: 0.7635
Validation Loss: 0.4907
The model performs better on validation than training(not overfitting yet).

# Epoch 2/3
Training Accuracy: 0.7583
Training Loss: 0.4941
Validation Accuracy: 0.8039
Validation Loss: 0.4233
The model improved significantly. Validation accuracy is over 80%.

# Epoch 3/3
Training Accuracy: 0.8079
Training Loss: 0.4088
Validation Accuracy: 0.8171
Validation Loss: 0.4070
Slight further improvement. Both training and validation accuracy are over 80%. Loss is also lower.
