# Cat vs Dog Classifier using TensorFlow

This project demonstrates how to clean a dataset, load images, normalize data, build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), train the model, and visualize predictions using TensorFlow.

---

##  Step 1: Import Required Libraries

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import os
import shutil
import warnings
import logging
from PIL import ImageFile

1.tensorflow: Main ML library for building the CNN.

2.matplotlib.pyplot: Used to visualize predictions.

3.os, shutil: Help with directory and file handling.

4.warnings, logging: Suppress unnecessary logs.

5.PIL.ImageFile: Allows us to load and validate images
```

## Suppress TensorFlow Warnings

```python
os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
tf.get_logger().setLevel(logging.ERROR)
ImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES = True
```
## Prevent clutter in output by hiding warnings and logs.
LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES = True:
# TRUNCATED_IMAGES refers to images that are incomplete or not fully loaded
# Avoids crash if an image is incomplete or corrupted.


os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'
#This line tells TensorFlow to suppress logging from its C++ backend.

Log levels:

'0': Show all logs (default)

'1': Filter out INFO messages

'2': Filter out INFO and WARNING messages

'3': Show only ERROR messages

# By setting it to '3', only critical error messages will be printed, reducing output clutter during program execution.

warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
# This line suppresses all warnings generated by Python, including DeprecationWarning, UserWarning, and others.

# This is useful when you want a cleaner console output and are aware that the warnings are not relevant to your current task.

tf.get_logger().setLevel(logging.ERROR)
# TensorFlow has its own logging system at the Python level. This line sets the TensorFlow logger to only display error messages.

# This further reduces console clutter by hiding TensorFlow's info and warning messages during model loading, training, or evaluation.

ImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES = True
# This is part of the Pillow (PIL) library. Some images may be partially downloaded or slightly corrupted.

# Setting this to True allows such images to be loaded instead of raising an error, which is especially helpful when working with large datasets where a few images may be damaged.
