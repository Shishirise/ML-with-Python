## Gemini AI Chatbot using Python Flask
I have created a personal AI chatbot using Python Flask for the backend and Gemini (Google Generative AI) for the AI responses. The chatbot interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a clean and userfriendly web UI.

# Key Features:
```
Frontend:
Built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript
Responsive layout with input field and styled chat window
Users can type messages and receive real time AI replies

Backend:
Developed using Flask (Python)
API endpoint (/chat) processes user messages
Integrates with Gemini API using a valid API key

AI Integration:
Utilizes Google Generative AI (Gemini Pro)
Processes user inputs and returns intelligent, natural language responses
Works like a lightweight ChatGPT clone
```
## Frontend
I developed a responsive and clean frontend interface for a Personal AI Chatbot using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This interface allows users to type and send messages and receive AI responses in a smooth and engaging chat window.

#  Key Components:
 ```
HTML:
Structured layout with a chat container, message display area, and input form.
Simple and semantic markup for easy integration with the backend.

CSS:
Custom styling using internal <style> tags.
Light theme with white background, pale blue buttons, and rounded corners.
Designed for clarity and readability with proper spacing, scrollable message box, and modern feel.

JavaScript:
Handles message sending, receiving responses via fetch() to the Flask API.
Displays user and bot messages dynamically.
Smooth auto-scroll and input field behavior (Enter key support + send button).
