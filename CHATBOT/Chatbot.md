## Gemini AI Chatbot using Python Flask
I have created a personal AI chatbot using Python Flask for the backend and Gemini (Google Generative AI) for the AI responses. The chatbot interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a clean and userfriendly web UI.

# Key Features:
```
Frontend:
Built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript
Responsive layout with input field and styled chat window
Users can type messages and receive real time AI replies

Backend:
Developed using Flask (Python)
API endpoint (/chat) processes user messages
Integrates with Gemini API using a valid API key

AI Integration:
Utilizes Google Generative AI (Gemini Pro)
Processes user inputs and returns intelligent, natural language responses
Works like a lightweight ChatGPT clone
```
